## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM approach
### What I learned

I learned how to use the BEM approach to add relevant blocks, elements and modifiers on the various HTML elements on the page. This makes writing CSS easier and more managable even though this is a small project.

### Continued development

I want to learn more about the typography and properly using the right font-weight, font-size etc.. I also need to learn more about accessibility and how to include this in the initial markup.
